You are free to report issues or submit pull requests. In that case it is required for you to update tests accordingly and document the changes in readme.md file. Don't update version number of the framework, we will do it when creating new release.

Always create new branch in your forked repository and submit pull request to merge into *master* branch.

Even small help with development of this framework will earn you spot in credits for our upcoming game. Don't hesitate if you would like to eg. fix some typo in readme file.
